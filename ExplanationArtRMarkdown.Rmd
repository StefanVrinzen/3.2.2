## The make_art function

This make_art function can be used to generate wonderful pieces of art that, from my visionary perspective, reflect different observations of a moon. 

The function takes two arguments: 

1. The amount of rings forming the moon

2. The size of the rings forming the moon 


An example of input can be found below.

```
make_art(30,5)
```
